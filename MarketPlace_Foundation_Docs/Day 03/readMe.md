## Sanity Schema for Product
Here is the schema definition for the `Product` document in **Sanity Studio**:

```typescript
import { ShoppingBagIcon } from "lucide-react";
import { defineType } from "sanity";

export const product = defineType({
    name: "product",
    title: "Product",
    type: "document",
    icon: ShoppingBagIcon,
    fields: [
        {
            name: "title",
            title: "Title",
            validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
            type: "string"
        },
        {
            name: "description",
            type: "text",
            validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
            title: "Description",
        },
        {
            name: "productImage",
            type: "image",
            validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
            title: "Product Image"
        },
        {
            name: "price",
            type: "number",
            validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
            title: "Price",
        },
        {
            name: "tags",
            type: "array",
            title: "Tags",
            of: [{ type: "string" }]
        },
        {
            name: "dicountPercentage",
            type: "number",
            title: "Discount Percentage",
        },
        {
            name: "isNew",
            type: "boolean",
            title: "New Badge",
        }
    ]
});
```

## API Fetching Code Snippet
This is the API fetching code to retrieve the `Product` data from Sanity:

```javascript
const res = await client.fetch(groq`*[_type=="product"]{
    _id,
    title,
    "imageUrl": productImage.asset->url,
    price,
    tags,
    dicountPercentage,
    description,
    isNew
}`);
```

## Importing Data to Sanity
Here is the code snippet to upload product images and data to Sanity:

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@sanity/client';

const client = createClient({
    projectId: '63kj3oiu',
    dataset: 'production',
    useCdn: true,
    apiVersion: '2025-01-13',
    token: '<your-token>'
});

async function uploadImageToSanity(imageUrl) {
    try {
        console.log(`Uploading image: ${imageUrl}`);
        const response = await fetch(imageUrl);
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Failed to fetch image: ${imageUrl}`);
        }

        const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
        const bufferImage = Buffer.from(buffer);

        const asset = await client.assets.upload('image', bufferImage, {
            filename: imageUrl.split('/').pop(),
        });

        console.log(`Image uploaded successfully: ${asset._id}`);
        return asset._id;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to upload image:`, imageUrl, error);
        return null;
    }
}
```
